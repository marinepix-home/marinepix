<p>Hi! Thanks for showing an interest in my courses!</p><br>

<p>
I'm currently going through a phase of doing night-time photography. The skies are quite clear and the milkyway tends to be highest in the sky around this time of year. Plus, it's much warmer than in the depths of winter so I dont freeze while I'm waiting for the latest timelapse to complete.<br>
So, if you're interested in doing some astro photos, be it star-trails or milkyway stuff, please drop me a line.

Otherwise, check out some of the types of course I can offer:
</p>
</div>
  <div class="courseblock">
    <div class="coursename"><h2>First Principles</h2></div>
    <div class="coursedetail"><p>Covers shutter speeds, apertures and ISO settings as well as a discussion about how to create a correctly exposed image. This course lasts between 2 and 3 hours and is run in a classroom environment. Depending on time we can also cover file formats (RAW, JPG, etc) and White Balancing</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="courseblock">
    <div class="coursename"><h2>Guided Practice Shoot</h2></div>
    <div class="coursedetail"><p>After First Principles, it's time to put knowledge into practice. We'll meet you for an outdoor photoshoot in the South-Downs area and you can practice using the light and the scenery to create some beautiful photos. We will provide guidance, encouragement, inspiration and tips on composition too as well as reminders of the basic principles. This is normally a morning course (and <em>may</em> call for an early start!). Our intention is to make use of the early morning light but also give you the chance to look at your images on the computer the same day.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="courseblock">
    <div class="coursename"><h2>Basic Post-Processing</h2></div>
    <div class="coursedetail"><p>We'll show you the basic principles of post-processing in order to get the most from your images. We'll help you understand WHY post processing is necessary and HOW it can be done simply and quickly. Although we will use Adobe's &quot;Lightroom&quot; to show you the techniques, the principles are very easily transferred. This course will take 2-3 hours and we'd hope to work with some of the images that you have taken.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="courseblock">
    <div class="coursename"><h2>Underwater Photography</h2></div>
    <div class="coursedetail"><p>If you  have a waterproof housing for your camera, we can introduce you to the  principles of taking photos underwater. We'll use a local, heated swimming pool and using a series of photo-worthy objects we'll explain the nuances of underwater photography. We'll review First Principles and talk about getting the exposure of your image correct. We'll also cover some basic rules of underwater photography, coping with low visibility water, avoiding &quot;everything looks blue&quot; situations. Photographing animals . The course is 3 hours long with up to 2 hours in the pool. You'll get more from this course if you're a scuba diver but it's not a requirement.</p></div>
